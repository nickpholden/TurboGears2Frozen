Description: About TurboGears2Frozen
        -------------------------
        This is a Turbogears meta package that lists the exact packages and versions that common 
        Turbogears installs need to run.
        
        We list the packages here so you can make a standard setup.py without messing around with pip
        freeze, or performing a non standard install using the Turbogears Repository.
        
        Use this package if
        -------------------------------
        Have you ever wanted to deploy a python package with Turbogears as a dependency but
        are worried what will be installed with the single tg.devtools/Turbogears2 dependency?
        
        Have you ever installed Turbogears on your dev machine then come to install your package
        that depends on Turbogears on a prod machine only to find that one of the packages
        Turbogears depends on has changed, breaking your prod install?
        
        Do you want to tell your users to just pip install <your package> that relies on Turbogears, rather
        that having to tell them to run a custom command first to install Turbogears from the TG Repo.
        
        Using
        -------------------------------
        Your application's setup.py might look like:
        
            #!/usr/bin/env python
            import setuptools
            from distutils.core import setup
            
            from sys import version
            from setuptools import find_packages
                
            setup(name='MyPackageUsingTG',
                  install_requires=(
                    """
                    TurboGears2Frozen==0.9.6
                    """
                    ),
                    version='0.0.1',
                    description='My package that uses Turbogears but doesn't have loads of dependencies listed',
