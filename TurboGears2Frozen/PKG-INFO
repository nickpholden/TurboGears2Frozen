Description: About TurboGears2Frozen
        -------------------------
        This is a Turbogears meta package that lists the exact packages and versions that common 
        Turbogears installs need to run.
        
        We list the packages here so you can make a standard setup.py without messing around with pip
        freeze, or performing a non standard install using the Turbogears Repository.
        
        Use this package if
        -------------------------------
        Have you ever wanted to deploy a python package with Turbogears as a dependency but
        are worried what will be installed with the single tg.devtools/Turbogears2 dependency?
        
        Have you ever installed Turbogears on your dev machine then come to install your package
        that depends on Turbogears on a prod machine only to find that one of the packages
        Turbogears depends on has changed, breaking your prod install?
        
        Do you want to tell your users to just pip install <your package> that relies on Turbogears, rather
        that having to tell them to run a custom command first to install Turbogears from the TG Repo.
        
        Using
        -------------------------------
        TG2Frozen has all the standard dependancies apart from MYSQL-python (as you may be using a different DB) and it
        does not contain a specific sqlalchemy version, as there are backward compatibility issues and you may want to
        use a particular version.
        
        Your application's **setup.py** might look like::
        
            import setuptools
            from distutils.core import setup
            
            from sys import version
            from setuptools import find_packages
                
            setup(name='MyPackageUsingTG',
                  install_requires=(
                    """
                    TurboGears2Frozen==2.1.5
                    SQLAlchemy==0.7.0
                    MySQL-python==1.2.3
                    """
                    ),
                    version='0.0.1',

                    author='Joe Bloggs',
                    author_email='joe@bloggs.c',
                    packages=find_packages(exclude=['ez_setup'])
                    )
                    
        Problems
        -------------------------------
        This package works for my stuff, but I expect it will not for everyone so please email me if you feel
        that other packages should be included.
        
        I'll update this package as I need the updates, if you need something sooner give me a mail. 
        
        I'm going to keep the numbering the same as the underlying TG package, may be increment it by a fourth
        number if a TG dependency needs updating.
        
        Thanks
